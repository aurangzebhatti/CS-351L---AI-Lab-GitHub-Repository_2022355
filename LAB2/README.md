This is a Python-based game where Pac-Man navigates through a grid filled with random obstacles while avoiding ghosts. The game uses the A* algorithm for pathfinding, allowing Pac-Man to find the shortest path to the goal, and ghosts to chase Pac-Man from random positions.

Features

Generates a customizable grid where Pac-Man, ghosts, and obstacles are randomly placed.
Uses the A* search algorithm to calculate the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal.
Ghosts chase Pac-Man by calculating their paths using the same A* algorithm.
The grid dynamically updates, showing Pac-Man’s and the ghosts' paths.
How It Works

Pac-Man starts at the top-left corner of a user-defined grid.
Ghosts are randomly placed in the grid, and obstacles are randomly generated.
Pac-Man’s goal is to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.
Both Pac-Man and ghosts use the A* algorithm to find their way through the grid.
